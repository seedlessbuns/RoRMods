# Legacy Infusion

## By Seedlessbuns

Infusion is back baby! This mod allows you to change or remove the maximum hp from infusion, and grants .5 max hp per infusion on killing enemies, just like in Risk of Rain 1. If you want Legacy Legacy Infusions (lmao) set the risk of rain 1 scaling option to false to go back to 1 hp per infusion.

V 1.0.1: Removed testing code that gave infusions on pressing F2 (ooops)

V 1.1.0: Created config file to set a hp limit per infusion

V 1.1.1: Removed testing code AGAIN (what is wrong with me)

V 1.2.0: Made the mod true to its name by making health scale by .5 per infusion after your first. (Thanks to anticode for the tip)
